               ubiquitous within hospitals. The data contains valuable
               information on the care of patients and their response to
               treatments, offering exciting opportunities for research.
               Typically, data are stored within archival systems that are not
               intended to support research. These systems are often
               inaccessible to researchers and structured for optimal storage,
               rather than interpretability and analysis. Here we present
               MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database sourced from the
               electronic health record of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
               Center. Information available includes patient measurements,
               orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified
               free-text clinical notes. MIMIC-IV is intended to support a wide
               array of research studies and educational material, helping to
               reduce barriers to conducting clinical research.",

  abstract = "An increasing amount of research is being devoted to applying
              machine learning methods to electronic health record (EHR) data
              for various clinical purposes. This growing area of research has
              exposed the challenges of the accessibility of EHRs. MIMIC is a
              popular, public, and free EHR dataset in a raw format that has
              been used in numerous studies. The absence of standardized
              preprocessing steps can be, however, a significant barrier to the
              wider adoption of this rare resource. Additionally, this absence
              can reduce the reproducibility of the developed tools and limit
              the ability to compare the results among similar studies. In this
              work, we provide a greatly customizable pipeline to extract,
              clean, and preprocess the data available in the fourth version of
              the MIMIC dataset (MIMIC-IV). The pipeline also presents an
              end-to-end wizard-like package supporting predictive model
              creations and evaluations. The pipeline covers a range of
              clinical prediction tasks which can be broadly classified into
              four categories - readmission, length of stay, mortality, and
              phenotype prediction. The tool is publicly available at
              https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline.",

              public health threats in this century. The first World Health
              Organization (WHO) Global report on surveillance of AMR,
              published in April 2014, collected for the first time data from
              national and international surveillance networks, showing the
              extent of this phenomenon in many parts of the world and also the
              presence of large gaps in the existing surveillance. In this
              review, we focus on antibacterial resistance (ABR), which
              represents at the moment the major problem, both for the high
              rates of resistance observed in bacteria that cause common
              infections and for the complexity of the consequences of ABR. We
              describe the health and economic impact of ABR, the principal
              risk factors for its emergence and, in particular, we illustrate
              the highlights of four antibiotic-resistant pathogens of global
              concern - Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
              non-typhoidal Salmonella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis - for
              whom we report resistance data worldwide. Measures to control the
              emergence and the spread of ABR are presented.",
