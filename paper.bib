  abstract  = "Digital data collection during routine clinical practice is now
               ubiquitous within hospitals. The data contains valuable
               information on the care of patients and their response to
               treatments, offering exciting opportunities for research.
               Typically, data are stored within archival systems that are not
               intended to support research. These systems are often
               inaccessible to researchers and structured for optimal storage,
               rather than interpretability and analysis. Here we present
               MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database sourced from the
               electronic health record of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
               Center. Information available includes patient measurements,
               orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified
               free-text clinical notes. MIMIC-IV is intended to support a wide
               array of research studies and educational material, helping to
               reduce barriers to conducting clinical research.",

  abstract = "An increasing amount of research is being devoted to applying
              machine learning methods to electronic health record (EHR) data
              for various clinical purposes. This growing area of research has
              exposed the challenges of the accessibility of EHRs. MIMIC is a
              popular, public, and free EHR dataset in a raw format that has
              been used in numerous studies. The absence of standardized
              preprocessing steps can be, however, a significant barrier to the
              wider adoption of this rare resource. Additionally, this absence
              can reduce the reproducibility of the developed tools and limit
              the ability to compare the results among similar studies. In this
              work, we provide a greatly customizable pipeline to extract,
              clean, and preprocess the data available in the fourth version of
              the MIMIC dataset (MIMIC-IV). The pipeline also presents an
              end-to-end wizard-like package supporting predictive model
              creations and evaluations. The pipeline covers a range of
              clinical prediction tasks which can be broadly classified into
              four categories - readmission, length of stay, mortality, and
              phenotype prediction. The tool is publicly available at
              https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline.",

  author    = "Hempel, Lars and Sadeghi, Sina and Kirsten, Toralf",
  abstract  = "Accurately estimating the length of stay (LOS) of patients
               admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in relation to their
               health status helps healthcare management allocate appropriate
               resources and better plan for the future. This paper presents
               predictive models for the LOS of ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV
               database based on typical demographic and administrative data,
               as well as early vital signs and laboratory measurements
               collected on the first day of ICU stay. The goal of this study
               was to demonstrate a practical, stepwise approach to predicting
               patient's LOS in the ICU using machine learning and early
               available typical clinical data. The results show that this
               approach significantly improves the performance of models for
               predicting actual LOS in a pragmatic framework that includes
               only data with short stays predetermined by a prior
               classification.",
