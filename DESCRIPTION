Description: |
  designed for analyzing the MIMIC-IV dataset, a repository of freely available
  electronic health records. It offers a suite of data wrangling functions
  tailored specifically for preparing the dataset for research purposes,
  particularly in antimicrobial resistance studies. It simplifies
  complex data manipulation tasks, allowing researchers to focus on their
  primary inquiries without being bogged down by wrangling complexities.
